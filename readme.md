# JS Doc Basic Example

> Simple example of using JSdoc in a basic NodeJS App üëç

## Get Started

This example is using a blank WordPress installation along with a default DataBase. If you want to use your existing WordPress Installation replace wp.sql with your WordPress SQL backup. If you change the name of wp.sql be sure to change the reference to it as well in the `.docker-compose.yaml` file:

To install and run the example, first clone the repository and optionally replace the "jsdocExample" directory with your desired name.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/greatdane89/docjs-example.git jsdocExample
```

```bash
#Navigate into proper directory
cd jsdocExample

#install dependencies
npm install

#Run the application
npm run doc

```

Visit jsdocExample/docs/ in your file system and open `index.html` in your browser.
